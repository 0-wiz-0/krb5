Kerberos Documentation Relay
============================

Philosophy
----------

- The documentation must be useful;

- The documentation must be correct;

- The documentation must be detailed, but optimized. No verbose mode;

- The documentation should be built incrementally;

- The documentation should be easy to maintain;

- The documentation should be examined to identify the approaches
   that do not work;
